# architecture but also the required Xtensa toolchain binaries. We save the
# required exports to a file for later processing, to handle around some
# weirdness with GitHub runners (see below for details). If a version number
# formatted following semver is provided, attempt to install that version of
# the compiler. If no version was specified, or 'latest' was provided, do not
# specify the toolchain version.

# With the required exports specified by the rust-build installation script
# saved to a file, we can simply `source` it to export said variables. GitHub
# runners are a bit strange, however, in that we need to update the
# `$GITHUB_PATH` variable instead of `$PATH` as we normally would. More details
# see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68214331
